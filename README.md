## Overview
This plugin provides audible and toast notifications when finding flatpak package updates and allows the user to update them at their leisure or automatically at user-defined intervals. The notifications can be toggled off if completely silent updates are preferred.

## Installation
1. [Install decky-loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader#installation)
2. Use the built in plugin store to download the AutoFlatpaks plugin

## Notes
- All settings changes are instantly applied
- A full flatpak manager interface probably won't happen (there is the Discover store)

## Thanks
